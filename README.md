# HostelManagementSystem
#### This project focuses on implementing unitTest (UT) and integrationTest (IT) for the Hostel Management System
We need to make use of TTD, Junit and Mockito while building a Hostel Management System. The system supports the following actions:

Students can register on the system.

Students can request a bed space.

You can find all students in a Hostel by providing the name of the Hostel.

You can find all students in a room by providing the room id.

The domain classes / database table used in this program are Hostel, Room, Student, HostelName, BedSpace, and Gender.

The system comprises two male hostels and two female hostels.

Each Hostel consists of twenty Rooms.

Each Room consists of four Bedspaces.
